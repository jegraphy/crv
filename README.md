# Cerverse Landing Page

This repository contains a basic Next.js + Tailwind CSS project for the Cerverse landing page. The initial version shows a "coming soon" screen with email collection and social links. It is structured to be extended with more sections in the future.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Email submissions currently log to the console. Integrate your preferred mailing service in `src/components/EmailForm.tsx`.
